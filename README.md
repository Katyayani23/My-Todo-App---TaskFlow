# My-Todo-App---TaskFlow


# 📝 TaskFlow - Personal Productivity Todo App

**TaskFlow** is a responsive, browser-based Todo application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks effectively. 
This project was developed following the assignment guidelines provided by **Interview Kickstart**, and expands on them with real-world features such as due dates, avatar customization, 
and task status tracking — all managed using **localStorage** (no backend required).
